# Entry 1: Choosing My Tool and Project
#### 11/7/22

I decided on Melon as my tool, and I am going to make a 2D platformer game with it. I've considered using Impact but didn't use it because I didn't know how to start tinkering with it and couldn't find any up to date tutorials on it. I am on stage 3 or 4 of the Engineering Design Process (EDP). Two skills I grew in are "How to Google" and "How to learn" because I had to research a tool and tinker with it.
