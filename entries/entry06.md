# Entry 6
##### 5/25/23

Some takeaways from the Expo are
* the more you present, the more comfortable you get
* be more confident about presenting your project
* talk louder so people can hear you over the noise
Some takeaways from the presentation are
* check every slide before presenting
    * change the yellkey link every day (because I forgot to update the yellkey link)
* presenting in-class and at the Expo wasn't as bad as I thought

My notes are [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16m7Awbim2iZ1glJXVBZyd0T4XameU0i7uovUbmjZH1s/edit), and my slides are [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1YDjExDAkW3m6m1cd-Cg7B-AbnVsoNKu0bNLqVaH5fN4/edit).
I am on the last step (step 8) of the Engineering Design Process. It is about communicating the results, which is done by presenting my project in-class and at the Expo.

A skill I grew in was communication by presenting my project in the Expo and doing an in-class presentation. Another skill I grew in was time management because I had to prioritize the presentation and work on it over the weekend and on Monday after.
